#xferlog_enable
#	If enabled, a log file will be maintained detailling uploads and downloads.
#	By default, this file will be placed at /var/log/vsftpd.log,
#	but this location may be overridden using the configuration setting vsftpd_log_file.
#	Default: NO (but the sample config file enables it)

#xferlog_std_format
#	If enabled, the transfer log file will be written in standard xferlog format, as used by wu-ftpd.
#	This is useful because you can reuse existing transfer statistics generators.
#	The default format is more readable, however.
#	The default location for this style of log file is /var/log/xferlog,
#	but you may change it with the setting xferlog_file.
#	Default: NO

# -e 's@#xferlog_std_format=YES@xferlog_std_format=YES@'

#vsftpd_log_file
#	This option is the name of the file to which we write the vsftpd style log file.
#	This log is only written if the option xferlog_enable is set, and xferlog_std_format is NOT set.
#	Alternatively, it is written if you have set the option dual_log_enable.
#	One further complication - if you have set syslog_enable,
#	then this file is not written and output is sent to the system log instead.
#	Default: /var/log/vsftpd.log

#xferlog_file
#	This option is the name of the file to which we write the wu-ftpd style transfer log.
#	The transfer log is only written if the option xferlog_enable is set, along with xferlog_std_format.
#	Alternatively, it is written if you have set the option dual_log_enable.
#	Default: /var/log/xferlog
